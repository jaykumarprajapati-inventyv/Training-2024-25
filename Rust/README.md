# Rust Programming Language
 - Rust is a modern systems programming language known for its focus on performance, safety, and concurrency. With its powerful memory management  features, Rust eliminates the need for garbage collection, offering zero-cost abstractions that ensure high efficiency. Its strong static typing and ownership model prevent memory errors, such as null pointer dereferencing and data races, making it an ideal choice for building reliable and fast applications.

 
## Folder Structure

 - This folder contains below main Two folder.
   - (1) Rust Learning:- This folder contains all Rust concepts from official documentation. It is one type of tutorials.
   - (2) Tasks:- It has below two sub folders.
