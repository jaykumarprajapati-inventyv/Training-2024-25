(1) What is packages and crate with its types?
(2) Export Code from a Crate:- 
    > The "pub" keyword makes functions, structs, and modules available outside the crate.
    > pub mod (super_keyword), pub use

(3) Import Code from Another Crate:-
    > By using 
      (a) mod (outer_module in main)
      (b) use (use_as_in main )
      (c) (alias) use std::collections::HashMap as Map;
      (d) use std::io; // for standard library imports.
      (e) super keyword 
      (f) Selective Importing:- use std::io::{self, Write};
      (g) External dependencies through like rand.
